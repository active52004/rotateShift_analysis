\section{The Collision Probability of Y Set}
\paragraph{Glossary}
The symble, abbreviation and marks needed in expressing the shift stage and probability computation.
\subsection{Preliminaries}
\paragraph{Rotate Shifting}
This paragraph introduce the mechanism of block rotate shifting stage in CETD. 
\begin{itemize}
	\item rotate shifting is like whirling a wheel.
	\item the output blk of rotate shifting is determined by the input blk and the shift control parameter(No. of bits shifted)
	\item The value of input and output blks may not be 1-1 map.
\end{itemize}
Unlike logical shifting and arithmetic shifting, rotate shifting behaves like whirling a wheel. The empty position in a message blk shifted is filled by the bits shifted out. Figure 1 express the concept of rotate shift. 

We can refer that the result of rotate shifting a message blk depends on the value of blk and the bits shifted.  
If two message blocks whose value are identical are shifted with distinct R$_i$s, the result blocks may be identical.That means when R$_i$ fixed,the mapping from message blocks to the shifted result blocks is not injection. This case is expressed in Figure 2(a).
For two distinct message blocks, however, their result blocks may be identical when their R$_i$s are distinct. This case is expressed in Figure 2(b).
When the R$_i$s of two message blocks are identical, the equality of result blocks is same as the equality of their input blocks.

\subsection{Rotate Shifting and Y Set Collision}
\paragraph{Y Set Collision}
This paragraph should introduce some simple examples of Y Set Collision, explain in detail that what kind of input pair can cause Y set collision.
\begin{itemize}
	\item The blk-pair equality is maintained:(pattern and single block collision)
	\item Two distinctive blks produce an identical blk pair(shifting base and the effect on Y set)
	\item A special case, blks containing internal pattern and derived from same base. 
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{Replay Attack}
In the context of this paper, replay attack refers to the circumstances that the adversary copy the data-tag message block pair from memory at an old time point and try to pass the verification with this old copy at a new time point. In the scenario of replay attack , the data part and tag part of two message block pairs are identical respectively. The security of a tag generation design is evaluated by the probabilty that two tags equal when their relative data parts are identical. This probability is expressed as Pr[Tag Collision] in this paper. 
Figure x shows the status of each stage in CETD under replay attack. In this section , we analyze the behaviour of old and new Y set.

\paragraph{Single Block Collision}

\paragraph{The Collision of Block Set}

\subsection{The Y Set Collision in Each Case Of Input}
\paragraph{Probability of Y Set Collision}
This section should compute the Y set collision probability under replay attack for each input case.
\begin{itemize}
	\item The condition of X set pair under replay attack: Xa[i] = Xb[i]
	\item The Probability of Y set pair collision for each case of X set pair.
	\item A general case of X set pair and the related Y set collision probability
